This program coregisters a pair of images in sub-pixel precision.

It runs on python 3.6 (32bit).

The code is originally developed for sub-pixel coregistration process in:
1) Interferometric SAR program
2) Image stacking program for hunting space debris and small NEOs in multiple nightsky images

64bit version of the program is also available in GitHub:
